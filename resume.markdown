**[Link to my resume][zishi-wu-resume]**. Last updated in September 2024.

I am currently working as Software Engineer at Amazon. In my current role and my
previous role at AT&T, I have specialized in full stack web development and have used
a variety of technologies. My primary programming languages are Python, Java, and TypeScript.
I'm also experienced in working with relational databases such as Microsoft SQL Server.

Currently I am learning [FastAPI][fastapi], [PostgreSQL][postgresql], and [React][react] so that
I can create my own version of a Disney Lorcana card explorer similar to [Dreamborn][dreamborn].
Checkout my [blog posts][blog] for updates on this.
