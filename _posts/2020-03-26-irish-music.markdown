The first time I was touched when listening to Irish music was at the 
[Renaissance Fair](http://www.ren-fest.com/) in Deerfield Beach, FL. 
It was a weekend in March 2017, and I was exploring the Renaissance Fair
for the first time with my friends, who had gone the previous year.
A band called the Crimson Pirates stepped up to an open stage and began
playing [The Drunken Sailor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dwDXtRcTQI).
We all laughed at the stanza: 

`Put a spiny lobster in his britches, put a spiny lobster in his britches`
<br>
`Put a spiny lobster in his britches, early in the morning.`

But it was the next two songs that got me hooked on Irish music. 

The first was an upbeat song called 
[The Star of the County Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3LcfIDPKQ).
The narrator is a young man who recounts meeting a beautiful woman named 
Rosie McCann, near Banbridge town in County Down. I looked this up and 
[Banbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banbridge) is a real town in
Northern Ireland, and County Down is a real county! At the end of the song 
he plans to dress in his Sunday clothes to win her over at the Harvest
Fair.

Some of my favorite performances of `The Star of the County Down` have 
been done by:
- [The Coach House Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1Dp20CG6rw)
- [The Angelo Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkTI1L2Ap3s)

The second was a slower, whistful song called 
[The Black Velvet Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejdAoEDhqMA).
The narrator is another young man, albeit far unluckier than the previous
man. He too meets a beautiful woman, but she is an escort who robs a gold 
watch and puts it in his pocket. He is deemed guilty by a jury the next 
Monday and sentenced to "seven years of penal servitude" in
[Van Dieman's Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Diemen%27s_Land),
which is now the island of Tasmania off the coast of Australia.

My favorite performance of `The Black Velvet Band` has been done by:
- [Luke Kelly and The Dubliners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBRQM0vErH8)

Ever since I heard these songs, I've been listening to different Irish 
performers adapt the folk songs of their country. Suprisingly, the songs 
usually fit two categories: either they are fast and upbeat like 
`The Star of the County Down` or they are slow and whistful like 
`The Black Velvet Band`. Some songs are a mix of the two styles.

From the fast and upbeat songs, my favorites are:
- `I'll Tell Me Ma`
  - [The Clancy Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-wAmgxLdYo)
  - [Fianne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to02fQV5fzA)
  - [Tommy Makem & Barley Bree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXspcpsKHtw)


From the slow and melancholy songs, my favorites are:
- `Red is the Rose`
  -[Nanci Griffith and The Chieftains]

  - [Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem]
