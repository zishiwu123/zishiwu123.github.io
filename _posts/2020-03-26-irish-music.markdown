The first time I was touched when listening to Irish music was at the 
[Renaissance Fair](http://www.ren-fest.com/) in Deerfield Beach, FL. 
A band called the Crimson Pirates stepped up to an open stage and began
playing [The Drunken Sailor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dwDXtRcTQI).
We all laughed at the stanza: 

`Put a spiny lobster in his britches, put a spiny lobster in his britches`
`put a spiny lobster in his britches, early in the morning.`

But it was the next two songs that got me hooked on Irish music. 

The first was an upbeat song called 
[The Star of the County Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3LcfIDPKQ).
The narrator is a young man who recounts meeting a beautiful woman named 
Rosie McCann, near Banbridge town in County Down. I looked this up and 
[Banbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banbridge) is a real town in
Northern Ireland, and County Down is a real county! At the end of the song 
he plans to dress in his best Sunday clothes to win her over at the Harvest
Fair.

Some of the best favorite performances of this song have been done by:
[The Angelo Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkTI1L2Ap3s)
[Fianne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOTz8RGfdg8)
[The Coach House Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1Dp20CG6rw)

The second was a slower, whistful song called 
[The Black Velvet Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejdAoEDhqMA).
