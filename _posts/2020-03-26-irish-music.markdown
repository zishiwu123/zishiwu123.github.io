The first time I was touched when listening to Irish music was at the 
[Renaissance Fair](http://www.ren-fest.com/) in Deerfield Beach, FL. 
A band called the Crimson Pirates stepped up to an open stage and began
playing [The Drunken Sailor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dwDXtRcTQI).
We all laughed at the stanza: 

`Put a spiny lobster in his britches, put a spiny lobster in his britches`
<br>
`Put a spiny lobster in his britches, early in the morning.`

But it was the next two songs that got me hooked on Irish music. 

The first was an upbeat song called 
[The Star of the County Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3LcfIDPKQ).
The narrator is a young man who recounts meeting a beautiful woman named 
Rosie McCann, near Banbridge town in County Down. I looked this up and 
[Banbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banbridge) is a real town in
Northern Ireland, and County Down is a real county! At the end of the song 
he plans to dress in his Sunday clothes to win her over at the Harvest
Fair.

Some of my favorite performances of this song have been done by:
- [The Coach House Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1Dp20CG6rw)
- [The Angelo Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkTI1L2Ap3s)

The second was a slower, whistful song called 
[The Black Velvet Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejdAoEDhqMA).
The narrator is another young man, albeit far unluckier than the previous
man. He too meets a beautiful woman, but she is an escort who robs a gold 
watch and puts it in his pocket. He is deemed guilty by a jury the next 
Monday and sentenced to "seven years of penal servitude" in
[Van Dieman's Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Diemen%27s_Land),
which is now the island of Tasmania off the coast of Australia.

My favorite performance of this song has been done by:
- [Luke Kelly and The Dubliners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBRQM0vErH8)
